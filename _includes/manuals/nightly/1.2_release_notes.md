## Release notes for {{page.version}}

This section will be updated prior to the next release.

### Headline features

#### Templates DSL documentation

Foreman now has documentation for DSL used for templates writing. This should
make template writing process easier for non-Rubyists as well as for people who
aren't familiar with all the methods Foreman provides. Documentation is available
locally under `https://<fqdn>/templates_doc`. This documentation will be gradually
enhanced in future releases to cover all available methods and macros.

### Release Notes

### Deprecations

### Upgrade warnings

* Due to changes in the build process, the API docs shipped with foreman and its plugins will no longer contain information about the data types of search fields. These will still be available in the API documentation on the website, and can be generated locally if needed by running `foreman-rake apipie:cache` on your Foreman server.
